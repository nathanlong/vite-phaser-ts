# Vite + Phaser + TypeScript

This starter kit implements native browser features for prototyping with Phaser:

- Phaser
- TypeScript
- Prettier
- ESLint

## Install and Setup

The intent is for this to be used with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) as a quick prototype kit. To grab a clean copy:

`degit nathanlong/vite-phaser-ts my-new-project`

`cd` into your new prototype, then install Vite with:

`npm install`

Then have Vite spin up a local server:

`npm run dev`

### Happy Prototyping ðŸ˜Ž
